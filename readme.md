BLOG WEBSITE
 
A blog website uses HTML, CSS, and JS in frontend and Django backend. This project helped me a lot to learn CRUD in Django. Everyone can go through it for an idea in Django.

Features:

Login and Logout
Home page for all blogs of users
Filters and Search option on home page
Create page for writing new blogs
My post page for users to edit, draft and delete

Home page:



Usage:

Create a folder blog
	git clone https://github.com/saheersk/Blog

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies 
	python -m venv venv
	source venv/bin/activate

Then install the dependencies:
	pip install -r requirements.txt

Then
	cd project-name
	python manage.py runserver

The project will run now and you can check its feature.
